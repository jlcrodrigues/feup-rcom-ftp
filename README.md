# RCOM FTP Application

This project is a part of the Computer Networks curricular unit @ FEUP.
The idea was to set up a network in the laboratory as shown bellow. 
This included its testing and analysis, as described in the [report](/docs/report.pdf).
Furthermore, a FTP application was developed to used with the setted up network. 
Its source code can be found [here](/src).
